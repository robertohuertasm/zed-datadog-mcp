# Datadog MCP Server extension

Simple extension exposing access to the Datadog Remote MCP server.

## Development

Sometimes Zed cannot uninstall the extension in Dev Mode. If that happens, you can manually remove the extension by deleting the entry from `~/Library/Application\ Support/Zed/extensions/index.json`.
